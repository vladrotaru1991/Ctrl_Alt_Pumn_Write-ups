## TL;DR

One-paragraph solution summary.

## Context

It’s almost midnight, the horror marathon is about to begin, and you desperately need coffee to stay awake. But the company’s new “smart coffee API” has gone rogue — it refuses to brew anything, no matter how you ask. Every request comes back with the same smug message:

“418: I’m a teapot.”

You can’t survive The Ring, Hereditary, and The Thing without caffeine. Somewhere deep in the server, there’s a way to convince this digital barista to make an exception — if you use the right method and flavor.

Can you persuade the teapot to serve one final cup before the night consumes you?

Note: The server insists it’s a teapot, but maybe… just maybe… it can still /brew.
