## TL;DR

One-paragraph solution summary.

## Context

The funeral home’s registration kiosk is old, creaky, and terribly miscounted. When you register, the clerk asks for your name — but one extra character in the wrong place can change everything. Inspect the program, find the off-by-one that lets a single byte flip the clerk’s privilege bit, and claim what it guards. Quiet now — the coffins are listening.

Hint 1: The program reads 33 bytes into a 32-byte name buffer. Try writing exactly one extra byte after the name.
