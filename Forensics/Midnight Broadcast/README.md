## TL;DR

One-paragraph solution summary.

## Context

Out of nowhere, a crackling signal appears on your radio — a vintage music station playing songs that shouldn’t exist. The melodies are warped, the voices distorted, and sometimes, between the notes, you hear whispers in a language you don’t know.

No one claims ownership, and every attempt to trace the broadcast fails. Some say the station only plays at midnight, drawing in anyone who listens too long.

Download the signal, listen closely, and uncover the secrets hidden in the static. The music remembers those who listen — but it never forgets.
