From the Ghost of the Portrait
October 31, 1899

Dear Seeker of Secrets,

If you are reading this, you have found my final message. On this Halloween 
night, as the veil between worlds grows thin, I leave you these cryptic words:

"In the realm of the living, images are more than what meets the eye. Within 
the canvas of my portrait, I have woven secrets using the ancient art of 
steganography - hiding text within the very fabric of the digital realm.

The old investigators had tools to extract truth from deception. They would 
examine artifacts not just with their eyes, but with commands that reveal 
hidden threats of characters, pulling forth what was meant to stay concealed.

Look beyond the painted surface. Search within the file itself, where binary 
meets text, where data hides in plain sight yet invisible to casual observers.

The forensic examiner knows: to find what is hidden in an image, one must 
read its metadata, its embedded secrets, its strings of readable text buried 
within the hexadecimal depths.

My flag awaits those clever enough to extract it from my portrait's digital soul."

Before I fade into the ether completely, I leave you with an encoded message. Decipher this, and your 
path forward shall become clear:

Those who understand the language of the web shall unlock this riddle.

                                                    - The Ghost
