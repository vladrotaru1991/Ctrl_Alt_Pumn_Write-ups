Diary of the Haunted Portrait Ghost
====================================

October 31, 1899

Dear Diary,

Tonight is Halloween, the one night I can communicate with the living.
I've hidden my greatest secret in this very portrait.

The key to finding it:
1. Examine every detail of my image
2. Read what others cannot see
3. The metadata holds clues
4. Simple tools reveal complex secrets

Do not be fooled by false flags like: rtech{th1s_1s_f4k3}

The real treasure is embedded where few think to look.
