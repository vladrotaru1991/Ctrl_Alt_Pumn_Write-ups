## TL;DR

One-paragraph solution summary.

## Context

The grimoire’s pages are digitally sealed with an old ritual key. The archivist rushed the signing, reusing a fragment of an old exponent — a small one. The seal looks genuine, but the ritual was reckless: shortcuts in the math leave cracks. If you pry one open, the spirit bound inside will be revealed.

Hint 1: The ciphertext was generated using the public key. (raw RSA, no padding)
Hint 2: Check RSA attacks for small private exponents (Wiener).
