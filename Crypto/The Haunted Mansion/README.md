## TL;DR

One-paragraph solution summary.

## Context

You find yourself trapped inside a mysterious mansion on Halloween night. You discover an exit, but it's locked with an ancient cipher mechanism. While wandering these dark halls, you notice three cryptic messages carved into the mansion's walls - each encoded with a DIFFERENT cipher. The mansion seems to distort reality itself - nothing is quite as it seems, and reflections dance strangely in the dusty mirrors that line the corridors. Decode all three messages and combine them to form the secret passphrase. Only then can you escape and claim your flag!

Hint 1: The code must be written with UPPERCASE letters and without spaces
Hint 2: Each decoded word will seem backwards... look for a mirror! 🪞
